# Free Palestine

Palestine has been fighting for it's rights since 1948, and now more than ever before - they need our help. This website serves a relay point of various articles and a donation link to the Palestine Children Relief Fund.

Martin Luther King Jr once said “Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.” We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly.

This fight isn't for any one caste, creed, religion or country, it's about fighting for the basic human rights of Palestine.

Pray for Palestine ❤️
